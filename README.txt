The content of the folders:

- Code:
This folder includes two notebooks to handle the data:
 - Cleaning_Validation_KNN: this notebook is used to clean the data and ensure is ready for evaluation, at the same time it creates a 
			    KNN model to predict on the data. 
			    The notebook will take the raw data as input and output different datasets used latter for the evaluation. 
 - Testing_Models: This notebook is the proposed solution to evaluate across the different datasets:
		   Training, Testing, Model Predictions


- Data:
This folder has the original dataset

- Output:
This folder has the cleanned and split datasets created by "Cleaning_Validation_KNN"
This datasets will be used as input for the Dashboards and for the notebook "Testing_Models"
